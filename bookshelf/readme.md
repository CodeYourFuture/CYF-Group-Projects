# Bookshelf App

In this project, you will build a bookshelf app. The app structure and design have been put in place. To complete the app, you'll need to add functionality so that read and unread books can be shown and the count updated.

## First Steps

1. Ask your project leader to set up a group repository based on the [sample repository](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/group-project-bookshelf).
2. Make sure each member in the group has forked from your project leader's repository.
3. Read the instructions in the app repository. Do you understand what's expected of you?
4. Discuss with your group how to divide up the project and assign responsibilities.
5. Read the rest of this document before beginning.

## Final Product

When you complete the project, we'll expect to receive a pull request at the [app repository](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/group-project-bookshelf) from your fork. This pull request should contain all the work you've done to implement the instructions.

Be sure to alert the mentors when you make the pull request so that we can review it.
