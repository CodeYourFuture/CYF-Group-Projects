books you have want to read and have read already.

Once you have cloned the repository, you can run the script with `npm run serve`.

## First Steps

1. Ask your project leader to set up a group repository based on this repository.
2. Make sure each member in the group has forked from your project leader's repository.
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Open the `app.js` file and read the instructions. Do you understand what you need to do?
5. Discuss with your group how to divide up the project and assign responsibilities.
6. Read the rest of this document before beginning.

## Final Product

When you complete the project, we'll expect to be able to clone the `master` branch of your group repository, run `npm run serve`, and see the completed app.

Be sure to alert the mentors when you have finished so that we can review it.
