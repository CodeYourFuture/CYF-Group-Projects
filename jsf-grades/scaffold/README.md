# JavaScript Fundamentals - Grade Report

In this project, you will work with your group to build a grade reporting tool. This tool generates student grade reports based on various criteria, i.e. displays grade in a specific format, grade rankings, how many students are passing, and grade average.

Once you have cloned the repository, you can run the script with `node app.js`.

## First Steps

1. Ask your project leader to set up a group repository based on this repository.
2. Make sure each member in the group has forked from your project leader's repository.
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Open the `app.js` file and read the instructions. Do you understand what you need to do?
5. Discuss with your group how to divide up the project and assign responsibilities.
6. Read the rest of this document before beginning.

## Final Product

When you complete the project, we'll expect to be able to clone the `master` branch of your group repository, run `node app.js`, and get the correct output for each line.

Once each task has been completed, you may notice that you run the same code for different tasks. As a group, discuss [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). Can you improve your code so that you are not repeating yourself?

Be sure to alert the mentors when you have finished so that we can review it.
