# JavaScript Fundamentals - Time Management

In this project, you will work with your group to build a small time management tool. This tool will help calculate when your next class is, when your dinner break is, and how much time you have left to study.

Once you have cloned, you can run the script with `node app.js`. Each time you run the script, it will run according to the current time. So if you run it at 11am and later at 6pm, you will get different results.

## First Steps

1. Ask your project leader to set up a group repository based on this repository.
2. Make sure each member in the group has forked from your project leader's repository.
3. Open the `app.js` file and read the instructions. Do you understand what you need to do?
4. Discuss with your group how to divide up the project and assign responsibilities.
5. Read the rest of this document before beginning.

## Final Product

When you complete the project, we'll expect to be able to clone the `master` branch of your group repository, run `node app.js`, and get the correct output for each line.

Be sure to alert the mentors when you have finished so that we can review it.
